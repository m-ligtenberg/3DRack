    apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

const model = await aiService.generateFromImage({
    image: uploadedImage,
    dimensions: moduleSpec,
    quality: 'high'
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **3D Viewer Not Loading**
   - Check WebGL support in browser
   - Update graphics drivers
   - Try different browser

2. **Image Upload Fails**
   - Check file size (max 10MB)
   - Verify file format (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
   - Clear browser cache

3. **Measurements Not Accurate**
   - Verify HP calculations (1 HP = 5.08mm)
   - Check input validation messages
   - Use metric measurements

### Performance Tips

- Use smaller images for better performance
- Close unused browser tabs
- Enable hardware acceleration
- Use Chrome for best performance

- `RackAssembler`: Virtual rack management
- `ExportManager`: File export functionality

### Extending the Application

**Adding New Control Types:**
```javascript
const newControlType = {
    name: 'slider',
    icon: 'ðŸ“¶',
    defaultSize: { width: 15, height: 45 },
    properties: ['min', 'max', 'default']
};

app.addControlType(newControlType);
```

**Custom Export Formats:**
```javascript
const customExporter = {
    format: 'step',
    extension: 'stp',
    export: (model) => {
        // Custom export logic
        return convertToSTEP(model);
    }
};

app.registerExporter(customExporter);
```
